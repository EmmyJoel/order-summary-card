What I learned
- While I worked on this design, I Learnt about the significance of paying attention to details.
- Definitely, I didn't produce a 100% replica of this design, but I must say I followed the pictoral details to a great length. I mean it's very easy for design details to go unoticed.
- Had a chance toexercise more on the dynamicity of CSS; got a good chance to learn more about the flexbox model.
- Learnt a lot about the basics of git and github [working on and through command line].


Continued development
- Oh yeah, I did encounter some hard time working with setting of widths and heights.
- I really would want to work more on this aspect of my web development journey. [a learning resource suggestion will really be apppreciated.]
- Ireally enjoyed working with the Git command line, I think I'll get a hang of it with more usage tho, so I definitely will have to do more with it to achieve this.


Useful resources
- Yeah, a list of resources that aided me in some certain dark areas?.

- (https://youtu.be/SWYqp7iY_Tc) - This youtube video by Traversy Media did helped ame alot with a detail explanation of the 'How' of git and Github per command line. I really would use more of his youtube courses going forward. And I do recommend this for anyone on this journey of web development. Newbie or not.
